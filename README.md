# twingly-search-api-java [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/twingly/twingly-search-api-java.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/twingly/twingly-search-api-java)

Java client for Twingly Search API (previously known as Twingly Analytics API). Twingly is a blog search service that provides a searchable API known as [Twingly Search API](https://developer.twingly.com/resources/search/).

## Example usage

```Java

import com.twingly.search.*;
public class Test{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        String apiKey = "API_KEY";
        // create Client object using your API key
        Client client = new UrlConnectionClient(apiKey);
        // Create Query object using QueryBuilder for results in English published from startTime to endTime
        Query query = QueryBuilder.create("spotify").documentLanguage(Language.English).startTime(startTime).endTime(endTime).build();
        Result result = client.makeRequest(query);
        // Get the total number of matches returned
        int numberOfMatchesReturned = result.getNumberOfMatchesReturned();
        // Get the total number of matches to the search query
        int numberOfMatchesTotal = result.getNumberOfMatchesTotal();
        // Get number of seconds it took to execute query
        double secondsElapsed = result.getSecondsElapsed();
        for (Post p : result.getPosts()){
            System.out.println(p.getUrl());             // print url for each post
            System.out.println(p.getTitle());           // print title for each post
        }
    }
}

```
A Query object can be reused for several requests.

To learn more about the features of this client, check out the example code that can be found in [example](example).

To learn more about the capabilities of the API, please read the [Twingly Search API documentation].

### API key from Java system properties

Additionally, you can create Client object with API key from Java system properties (property name is `TWINGLY_SEARCH_KEY`):

```Java
import com.twingly.search.client.*;
public class Test{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Client client = new UrlConnectionClient(); // create client object with API key from java system property
    }
}
```

To do so, you will need to run Java with property. For example, run `gradlew` with twingly search key property:

```
gradlew build -DTWINGLY_SEARCH_KEY=some_key_value
```

### Exception handling

Given exception hierarchy is now available:
* TwinglySearchException - super class for any TwinglySearch-related exception
    * TwinglySearchServerException - super class for all server exceptions
        * TwinglySearchServerAPIKeyDoesNotExistException - should be thrown when no API key was found
        * TwinglySearchServerAPIKeyUnauthorizedException - should be thrown when API key is not authorized for any action
        * TwinglySearchServerServiceUnavailableException - should be thrown when service is not available

## Requirements

* API key, contact [sales](mailto:sales@twingly.com) via [twingly.com](https://www.twingly.com/try-for-free/) to get one
* Java:
    * v 1.7
    * v 1.8

## Development

### Tests

Make sure you have all the dependencies

```
gradlew assemble
```

Run the tests

```
gradlew check
```

### JavaDoc generation

To generate java docs just run gradle task `javadoc`:

```
gradlew javadoc
```

This will save javadocs in `docs` folder under build-folder.

### One-jar generation

To generate one fat jar library with all compile dependencies just run gradle task `generateOneJar`:

```
gradlew generateOneJar
```

This will save JAR file with all needed dependencies in `build/libs/` with `-all` suffix. (like `twingly-search-api-java-all-0.0.1.jar`)
