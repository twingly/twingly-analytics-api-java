      \n  <title><![CDATA[3/11/2016: My Day Today]]></title>\r\n  <summary><![CDATA[This is my first actual blog entry that’s not some kind of background about me, which is pretty neat. \_Instead I feel like writing about my day today (even though this is being\
      \ published the next morning, so technically during the next day but whatever). \r\nI woke up around 9:45ish in the morning on about 5 hours of sleep, mainly a result of writing one of the blog’s Introductions (lol oops). \_I didn’t wanna wake up but I\
      \ had class at 11. \_So I begrudgingly got up and got ready, getting to class on time. \_My school day wasn’t all that interesting, with my Friday classes stacked straight from 11 to 3. \_I did get Panda Express with some friends at one point, though,\
      \ in between my 12 and 1 o’clock classes, so I guess that’s something out of the ordinary for me. \_Around 3 in the afternoon, though, what started as a beautiful day with hummingbirds (literally, I saw a couple while walking to my classes and they were\
      \ adorable) and blue sky turned into pouring fucking cats and dogs rain. \_Torrential shit, the kinda thing that people in California never knew existed. \_I usually love the rain, but I fucked up today. \_Today was different from the nice drizzles we\
      \ usually get, and I didn’t have an umbrella or coat or anything. \_I walked for maybe 15 minutes in torrential downpour in just jeans an a t-shirt to find my bike, completely waterlogging my clothes. \_After getting my bike I had to wait out the rain\
      \ in a dry spot until it lost some of its intensity, and luckily I met a dude there who turned out to be cool and helped take my mind off of how fucking cold I was. \_After he decided to leave, The rain started to lessen and I took off for the apartment.\
      \ \_My clothes were about twice as heavy as normal when I arrived. \r\nIt’s definitely a stupid thing to subject yourself to torrential rain for half an hour with only a T-shirt and pants on, but I had to get back to the apartment as soon as I could so\
      \ that Kian and I could leave for L.A. \_We’d bought tickets for Jack Garratt at the Fonda in Hollywood like three months ago, and Kian had invited his best friend’s girlfriend to come as well, though in a different car. \_I got all of my soppy-ass clothes\
      \ off, took an incredibly satisfying shower, and we hit the road to Hollywood in Kian’s yellow Eclipse. \_We car-karaoked our way through a little less than two hours of shitty LA traffic and arrived in Hollywood around 6pm-ish. \_Also on the way there,\
      \ my Mom called me out of the blue and said that she had just bought me and my sister tickets to see Pentatonix in May. \_Literally the night before this one, while checking Bandsintown for the first time in a week, \_I found out that Pentatonix are gonna\
      \ play in LA. \_I returned a missed call from Mom, which by the way was about something completely different, and suggested that the concert would be fun to take my little sister to, seeing that she absolutely fucking adores that band. \_So what did my\
      \ mom do? \_She bought both me and Erin tickets to seats super close to the stage. \_She even refrained from letting Erin know, letting me break the news to her by calling her. \_This is so beyond cool that I’m worried my concert ticket buying problem\
      \ is starting to rub off on my family. \_Oh God, what have I become? \r\nAnyway, back to Jack Garratt. \_After parking in a lot near the crossing of Hollywood and Cahuenga, we were both starving and I decided to take Kian to a place that I now love. \_\
      “Los Burritos,” on Hollywood Blvd, was a place I had already been to once (more on that later) with friends and they turned out to be as awesome now as they were then. \_Kian and I both ordered California burritos, which were hella good and I would definitely\
      \ recommend. \_I bought a couple churros to go for myself and we left for the Fonda, walking like 4 blocks to get there. \_Sabrina, the other person meeting up with us, had just parked near the place and we met up in line outside. \_Even though we got\
      \ there half an hour early, the line was already probably a hundred people strong, meaning we would have to wait. \r\nBefore I left the apartment, I had stuffed a cheeba-chew into an Altoids container to be used just in case. \_Of course I ate some, starting\
      \ when we were waiting in line and having more as the night progressed. \_Continuing my fantastic streak of sneaking shit into concerts, I got my cheeba-chew past security and we hung out maybe ten feet from stage waiting for the show to start. \_Once\
      \ it finally did, holy hell. \r\nKacy Hill, definitely a B.A.B. (stands for Bomb-Ass/Bad-Ass Bitch)\r\nThe opener for Jack Garratt was Kacy Hill, who Kian and I had listened to on the way there and liked. \_She was, first off, super duper hot, but hot\
      \ damn what a great voice. \_Her and her band put on a terrific show, with the keyboardist throwing his hair everywhere and the drummer absolutely losing her shit on drums. \_In all seriousness, she was even one of the best, most pumped up drummers I’\
      ve ever seen live in any band. \_Kacy also was so pumped up and happy to be singing for everyone that everyone in the theater couldn’t help but be happy for her, too. \_Hell, I’m happy that she’s following her dreams, since that means she and her band\
      \ get to make more awesome music that I’ll definitely stay caught up with. \_They performed maybe six songs, all of which were excellent, and about twenty minutes after their show ended, Jack Garratt finally came on stage. \r\nThis talented motherfucker\r\
      \nOriginally, when I first listened to him, Jack Garratt had maybe 5 singles on Spotify; his first album wasn’t quite out yet. \_Kian had told me about this guy he recently found on Spotify, saying that he had already bought concert tickets to see the\
      \ guy and that I should definitely come with him. \_I saved a couple Jack Garratt things and went off to class, but I didn’t listen to them for awhile. \_It wasn’t until I was biking back to the apartment after class that I saw Jack Garratt’s name in my\
      \ saved things and thought, “sure, might as well listen to this now.” \_I put on “Worry,” since it was the most popular, and holy shit as soon as the chorus hit I knew I wanted to see that song live. \_It wasn’t long until I found the rest of his stuff,\
      \ with “Fire” and “Breathe Life” becoming my favorites. \r\n\_ \r\nAs expected, Jack Garratt live is probably one of the coolest things I’ve ever seen. \_He’s a one-man act, firstly, and yet he still manages to create these awesome symphonic pieces that\
      \ have an impressive amount of ad-libbing in them. \_His songs fluctuate incredibly well between different tones, from chill to all-out-everyone-losing-their-shit, and dancing my pants off to both was incredibly fun. \_My favorite parts of the show were\
      \ definitely when Jack dropped his guitar and keyboard to focus entirely on his drum pad, creating some really mind-blowing beats. \_Jack’s goofiness between songs also lent a huge element of fun to his performance, adding to an already perfect example\
      \ of well-rounded live awesomeness. \_The merch was cash only, though, so I couldn’t buy anything after. \r\nAfter it ended, Sabrina gave us a ride back to Kian’s car and Kian gave me a ride back home to LA. \_He hung out with me and my dogs for a bit\
      \ then left back to UCI, a satisfying end to a neato day. \r\nTomorrow at 2pm I go to fill out paperwork to be reinstated at the Hollywood Bowl as an Usher, which is a job that I definitely love and can make enough off of to pay for Firefly Festival later\
      \ in June. \_Then, I get to whittle away at a comp sci project that’s due in two days and that I haven’t started. \_And next week is finals week. \_And on Friday I leave for Utah to go camping in Zion National Park until the next Wednesday, when my friends\
      \ are counting on me to be back in California in time to drive them from Irvine to LA to see one of our favorite bands play. \_The next two days after that, David Gilmour is playing at the Bowl and I’ll be working. \_Sweet Jesus. \r\nAnyhow, that was my\
      \ day today; it’s currently four in the morning and I’m munching on a tasty crepe that I guess my sister and her friends made earlier and left out for me. \_This is the first entry in a sort of project that I’m doing for myself, cataloging some of the\
      \ cool things I’ve done with my free time and money. \_I’m genuinely curious to see what kinds of things I can get myself into, and it’s incredible how much I still have to look forward to. \_For now, though, I’m tired and looking forward to sleeping in\
      \ late. \_The next blog entries will likely be more Introductions, with a background on my apartment and roomie situation as well as one on my family and home in LA. \_Until I do get the chance to post something else, though, I’ll leave this story here.\
      \ \_To any peoples reading, I guess I’ll just close by saying that having fun and going out isn’t necessarily a difficult or expensive thing to do. \_As you’ll learn from this blog, I like to enjoy life; it’s all I have, really. \r\nI’ve eaten maybe 5\
      \ of these by now\r\n\_ \r\nOfficial Los Burritos Site!\_— Definitely try them if you wanna eat somewhere on Hollywood Blvd that, even though it’s right in the middle of it all, likes to distance itself from all of Hollywood’s bullshit. \r\n\_ \r\nAlso\
      \ some other cool shows coming soon to the Fonda, for anyone interested: \r\n\r\nMiike Snow on April 20th, already sold out\r\nSteel Panther on May 4th, 11th, and 18th; Floor tickets still on sale\r\nMagic Man and the Griswolds on May 10th, surprisingly\
      \ still has Floor tickets\r\nIron & Wine with Marlon Williams on May 31st, still on sale\r\nYeasayer on June 1st, still on sale]]></summary>\r\n  <languageCode>en</languageCode>\r\n  <published>2016-03-12 12:21:08Z</published>\r\n  <indexed>2016-03-12\

      \ Routing™ finds curvy or hilly roads; limits major highways\r\nRider alerts for sharp curves, state helmet laws, speed cameras¹ and more\r\nHands-free calling and smartphone notifications² right on your z?mo screen\r\nControl music from MP3 player or\
      \ smartphone; stream Pandora®\_and Spotify®\_music services³\r\n\r\n\_ \r\n\r\n\r\nBuilt for Adventure, Born to Ride\r\nFeaturing Garmin Adventurous Routing options for those twisty, hilly, terrain-hugging rides you love, zumo 595LM is the motorcycle navigator\
      \ “built to thrill.” Its large, glove-friendly 5.0-inch high-res touchscreen can be viewed in landscape or portrait mode. And transflective technology gives it a bright, crisp color display that reduces glare and is easy to read in sunlight. \r\n\r\n\r\
      \n\r\n\_ \r\nThe Benefits of Hands-free Calling\r\nSync your zumo with a compatible smartphone², headset or helmet (sold separately), and you can make and receive wireless calls without having to remove your gloves or helmet. Safely stow your phone in\
      \ a pocket or saddlebag, and still have the benefit of hands-free calling without diverting your attention from the road. You can also receive customizable smart notifications³ for calls, texts, app alerts and more that appear right on your navigation\
      \ display. \r\n\_\_ \r\nRide Smarter with Your Smartphone\r\nWhat’s happening on the road ahead? z?mo 595LM can connect you to live weather radar and traffic information via the wireless\_Smartphone Link7\_app. This app also enables LiveTrack, a nifty\
      \ feature that lets friends track your whereabouts in real time whenever you’re out on a ride. \r\n\_ \r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy Some Traveling Music\r\nWant to take your own soundtrack along for the ride? Your zumo also lets you control music and media from a\
      \ compatible MP3 player or smartphone², right on your touchscreen display — and you can even stream the playlists you love from popular Pandora and Spotify music services³. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\_ \r\nKeep a Sharper Lookout with Rider Alerts\r\nTo enhance road\
      \ awareness and encourage a safer ride, zumo 595LM\_ provides helpful alerts for sharp curves ahead, speed changes, railroad and animal crossings, school zones and more. Additionally, you’re notified when you need to check state helmet laws — or when you’\
      re about to drive the wrong way on a one-way street. You also receive alerts for nearby red light and speed cameras¹. Plus, for longer rides, a fatigue warning4\_will even suggest break times and potential rest areas worth considering after hours on the\
      \ road. The zumo Up Ahead feature lets you easily see places of interest and milestones along your route, without leaving the map view on your navigation display. Plus, Easy Route Shaping lets you add a point on the map to adjust your route, so you can\
      \ ride through preferred areas or follow specific roads. \r\n\_ \r\n\_\_ \r\n\r\n\r\nNo More Running on Empty\r\nA built-in trip computer with digital fuel gauge comes standard with your z?mo 595LM. So it’s easy to estimate how many miles you can ride\
      \ before you’ll be running on empty. Dynamic fuel stop alerts actually prompt you when it’s time to refuel and even provide gas station location options. A helpful speed limit indicator lets you know when it’s time to throttle down. Plus, a digital compass\
      \ display and a database of motorcycle-specific points of interest (POIs) are on hand to help you locate cycle repair services, dealers and more. There’s also a Service History Log on your z?mo to help you keep track of service dates, mileage and performed\
      \ maintenance on your bike. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\_ \r\n\r\n\r\nGuidance Using Recognizable Landmarks\r\nGarmin Real Directions on the zumo 595LM virtually redefine the concept of “spoken turn-by-turn directions.” In addition to speaking street names, your\
      \ zumo offers guidance using recognizable landmarks, buildings and traffic lights (e.g., “Turn right after the red building”). \_And thanks to Foursquare data, zumo is preloaded with millions of more new and popular places to explore. In addition, the\
      \ Garmin Direct Access feature helps simplify your navigation to select complex destinations, like malls and airports, by providing detailed location information once you reach the recommended entrance. For example, “Arriving at Woodfield Mall. Foot Locker\
      \ is inside, on level two.” \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\_ \r\nLifetime Map Updates\r\nzumo 595LM includes free map updates5\_for the useful life of your device, so routes reflect the most up-to-date points of interest and maps available. \r\n\_ \r\n\r\n\r\nNavigation\
      \ Tools\r\nphotoReal Junction View displays realistic views of junctions and interchanges on your route to ease navigation through complex interchanges. A brightly colored arrow on the zumo display, along with helpful voice prompts, will indicate the proper\
      \ lane position needed for your next turn or exit. zumo 595 displays 3D Terrain and elevation information. There’s also a TracBack feature on zumo that allows you to navigate the same route, in reverse, for your return trip. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\_ \r\n\r\n\
      \r\nTire Pressure Monitoring\r\nFor added protection on the road, zumo 595LM is compatible with the Garmin\_Tire Pressure Monitor Sensor6\_(TPMS, sold separately). One TPMS is required for each tire and will work with metal valve stems only. TPMS uses\
      \ wireless technology to transmit the tire pressure data, letting you view it in real time right on your zumo display. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\_ \r\n\r\n\r\nVIRB®\_Camera Compatibility\r\nTo record the highlights of your ride, zumo 595LM is compatible with the\
      \ Garmin\_VIRB series\_of HD action cameras (sold separately). Remotely control VIRB –\_start and stop recording – all from from your z?mo display. It’s easy and fun to record relive every adventure. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\_ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdates and Extras\r\
      \nUse\_Garmin Express\_to keep your zumo 595LM up to date. Garmin Express makes it easy to update maps and software, transfer favorites to and from devices and install free custom vehicles and voices. Plus, for added versatility, your zumo 595LM also comes\

      \ \r\nDo I still buy music? Absolutely. Wouldn’t feel right not to. \r\nI pay monthly for Spotify Premium and Apple Music, I support 9 independent musicians on Patreon (which you can do for as little as $1 per month) plus 1 directly, I pre-order new albums\
