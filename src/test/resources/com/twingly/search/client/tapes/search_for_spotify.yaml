      \n  <title><![CDATA[Track Review – The Community of Hope / PJ Harvey]]></title>\r\n  <summary><![CDATA[In comparison to PJ Harvey’s last single, ‘The Wheel’, ‘The Community of Hope’ strides out of the gate with more confidence, less messing around, straight\
      \ in.\_It’s arguably much better, with less squealing guitars and instead a driving drumbeat with the guitar taking a backseat and more orchestration working its way in. The lyrics, rooted in the US, have more in common with Modest Mouse’s\_The Lonesome\
      \ Crowded West\_than the hyper-political\_Let England Shake,\_with Harvey singing ‘Now this is just drug town, just zombies, but that’s just life’ as she criticises pretty much everything wrong with America: the fast-paced life, dead drug towns, the government,\
      \ run-down schools sitting next to spotless Wal-Marts. She’s translated her cynical view of WW1 to America well, and while it might seem heavy-handed, PJ Harvey has rarely dealt in anything that isn’t upfront, often because it can be more uncomfortable\
      \ than disguising it in a metaphor. \r\nInstrumentally, the sound of\_The Hope Six Demolition Project\_is now forming more clearly – a departure from\_Let\_England Shake‘s experimental streak and more like her Mercury-winning\_Stories From The City, Stories\
      \ From The Sea,\_combining mid-paced rock with extra orchestration from the brass section. It’s probably going to be a good album for any PJ Harvey fans who want a ‘rock’ album, but probably not the scratchy punk of\_Rid Of Me.\_The horns work well, as\
      \ do the returning backing vocals which add a choir-like protest-song-likeness to lines like ‘They’re gonna put a Walmart here’, making even that line sound ominous. \r\nspotify:track:2AxjntkZpEf5Qt7KoiccHI]]></summary>\r\n  <languageCode>en</languageCode>\r\

      \ Routing™ finds curvy or hilly roads; limits major highways\r\nRider alerts for sharp curves, state helmet laws, speed cameras¹ and more\r\nHands-free calling and smartphone notifications² right on your z?mo screen\r\nControl music from MP3 player or\
      \ smartphone; stream Pandora®\_and Spotify®\_music services³\r\n\r\n\_ \r\n\r\n\r\nBuilt for Adventure, Born to Ride\r\nFeaturing Garmin Adventurous Routing options for those twisty, hilly, terrain-hugging rides you love, zumo 595LM is the motorcycle navigator\
      \ “built to thrill.” Its large, glove-friendly 5.0-inch high-res touchscreen can be viewed in landscape or portrait mode. And transflective technology gives it a bright, crisp color display that reduces glare and is easy to read in sunlight. \r\n\r\n\r\
      \n\r\n\_ \r\nThe Benefits of Hands-free Calling\r\nSync your zumo with a compatible smartphone², headset or helmet (sold separately), and you can make and receive wireless calls without having to remove your gloves or helmet. Safely stow your phone in\
      \ a pocket or saddlebag, and still have the benefit of hands-free calling without diverting your attention from the road. You can also receive customizable smart notifications³ for calls, texts, app alerts and more that appear right on your navigation\
      \ display. \r\n\_\_ \r\nRide Smarter with Your Smartphone\r\nWhat’s happening on the road ahead? z?mo 595LM can connect you to live weather radar and traffic information via the wireless\_Smartphone Link7\_app. This app also enables LiveTrack, a nifty\
      \ feature that lets friends track your whereabouts in real time whenever you’re out on a ride. \r\n\_ \r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy Some Traveling Music\r\nWant to take your own soundtrack along for the ride? Your zumo also lets you control music and media from a\
      \ compatible MP3 player or smartphone², right on your touchscreen display — and you can even stream the playlists you love from popular Pandora and Spotify music services³. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\_ \r\nKeep a Sharper Lookout with Rider Alerts\r\nTo enhance road\
      \ awareness and encourage a safer ride, zumo 595LM\_ provides helpful alerts for sharp curves ahead, speed changes, railroad and animal crossings, school zones and more. Additionally, you’re notified when you need to check state helmet laws — or when you’\
      re about to drive the wrong way on a one-way street. You also receive alerts for nearby red light and speed cameras¹. Plus, for longer rides, a fatigue warning4\_will even suggest break times and potential rest areas worth considering after hours on the\
      \ road. The zumo Up Ahead feature lets you easily see places of interest and milestones along your route, without leaving the map view on your navigation display. Plus, Easy Route Shaping lets you add a point on the map to adjust your route, so you can\
      \ ride through preferred areas or follow specific roads. \r\n\_ \r\n\_\_ \r\n\r\n\r\nNo More Running on Empty\r\nA built-in trip computer with digital fuel gauge comes standard with your z?mo 595LM. So it’s easy to estimate how many miles you can ride\
      \ before you’ll be running on empty. Dynamic fuel stop alerts actually prompt you when it’s time to refuel and even provide gas station location options. A helpful speed limit indicator lets you know when it’s time to throttle down. Plus, a digital compass\
      \ display and a database of motorcycle-specific points of interest (POIs) are on hand to help you locate cycle repair services, dealers and more. There’s also a Service History Log on your z?mo to help you keep track of service dates, mileage and performed\
      \ maintenance on your bike. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\_ \r\n\r\n\r\nGuidance Using Recognizable Landmarks\r\nGarmin Real Directions on the zumo 595LM virtually redefine the concept of “spoken turn-by-turn directions.” In addition to speaking street names, your\
      \ zumo offers guidance using recognizable landmarks, buildings and traffic lights (e.g., “Turn right after the red building”). \_And thanks to Foursquare data, zumo is preloaded with millions of more new and popular places to explore. In addition, the\
      \ Garmin Direct Access feature helps simplify your navigation to select complex destinations, like malls and airports, by providing detailed location information once you reach the recommended entrance. For example, “Arriving at Woodfield Mall. Foot Locker\
      \ is inside, on level two.” \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\_ \r\nLifetime Map Updates\r\nzumo 595LM includes free map updates5\_for the useful life of your device, so routes reflect the most up-to-date points of interest and maps available. \r\n\_ \r\n\r\n\r\nNavigation\
      \ Tools\r\nphotoReal Junction View displays realistic views of junctions and interchanges on your route to ease navigation through complex interchanges. A brightly colored arrow on the zumo display, along with helpful voice prompts, will indicate the proper\
      \ lane position needed for your next turn or exit. zumo 595 displays 3D Terrain and elevation information. There’s also a TracBack feature on zumo that allows you to navigate the same route, in reverse, for your return trip. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\_ \r\n\r\n\
      \r\nTire Pressure Monitoring\r\nFor added protection on the road, zumo 595LM is compatible with the Garmin\_Tire Pressure Monitor Sensor6\_(TPMS, sold separately). One TPMS is required for each tire and will work with metal valve stems only. TPMS uses\
      \ wireless technology to transmit the tire pressure data, letting you view it in real time right on your zumo display. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\_ \r\n\r\n\r\nVIRB®\_Camera Compatibility\r\nTo record the highlights of your ride, zumo 595LM is compatible with the\

      \n  <title><![CDATA[A Reintroduction and Digital Replicas: the Problem with Social Media Identity]]></title>\r\n  <summary><![CDATA[Hi, my name is Jesse Max Muir. I am 20 years old, a media studies student of the University of Wollongong, and a very digitally\
      \ integrated individual. As of this moment I possess two Tumblr accounts, a Facebook profile, a Twitter handle, an Instagram, Snapchat, Spotify, Youtube Channel and this WordPress account. For each of these I connect to 41 Tumblr followers, 465 Facebook\
      \ friends, 60 Twitter followers, 87 Instagram followers, 46 Snapchat friends, 0 Spotify followers, 1 YouTube subscriber (cheers mum) and 45 WordPress followers. For these various social media sites and applications you will find the same profile picture,\
      \ the same biography, and similar forms of content posted by myself. My digital footprint has been explicitly designed as an extension of myself, a practice which theorists such as Stacey Koosel to support, claiming that “The extension of a social self\
      \ and interpersonal interactions are accentuated and accelerated by the industry of gathering and selling personal information on the Internet” (Koosel, 2011) \r\nBe that as it may, if someone were to ask me how active I was on social media, or how much\
      \ I cared about my Facebook or Twitter followers, my reaction would go something like this: \r\n \r\nYes, unlike many I have posted ONE selfie in my life, rarely share content, and post on my own social media accounts even less (with the exception of my\
      \ written blogging). The main reason for this being my valuation of personal interactions, coupled by the fact that I just can’t nail that perfect camera angle. \r\nDespite my pessimistic view towards social media there are many that view their various\
      \ profiles and social followings as having profound impacts upon their social status. As argued by Alice Marwick (2013), social media has given rise to a hierarchy based on attention and visibility, an environment where quantified elements such as Klout\
      \ scores and follower numbers imply a level of influence, visibility and attention. Now that’s all well and good, but the downfalls of this digital attention economy can become seriously damaging. When someone has access to hundreds upon thousands of people\
      \ within their social networks it provides a level of power, to reach a boundless amount of people with the click of a button. But what happens if your latest selfie gets no likes, or that hilarious joke you posted on Facebook flops. Each new post can\
      \ present its own digital anxieties, so now just as you perceived yourself as popular from your media followings; audience feedback has the potential to reflect the exact opposite. The result could be timing your posts to reach the maximum amount of likes,\
      \ the continuous reposting of content to achieve more likes, and even the deletion of content that receives no attention. In here lies the issue, and is where concerns can start to emerge. \r\nA study conducted in 2012 by Facebook identified that of its\
      \ 1 billion accounts, 83 Million of them were fake (Facebook in Mosbergen, 2012). To put this into perspective, the population of Australia is only around 23 Million, so this is an astounding amount. Our attention economy and social media addiction has\
      \ influenced the creation of millions of fake media accounts, a phenomenon that has been coined as Catfishing. The visibility of Catfishing as an activity exploded in 2010 through the documentary of the same name, in which an American man Nev Schulman\
      \ presents his experience of falling in love with a fake ‘Catfish profile’. Amanda Kaskazi (2014) argues that Catfishing is more likely to occur on Twitter as people are more likely to make new connections and less likely to be cautious of an unfamiliar\
      \ profile. \r\n\r\n(Catfish trailer) \r\nThe reasoning behind these fake profiles can range from revenge, extortion, desperation and even boredom. Certain profiles even utilize their online personas for monetary gain such as the infamous Cassidy Boone\
      \ who famously claimed that vegemite is racist (Yes, you heard me correctly). \r\n\r\nAs another side effect, the amount of fake celebrity profiles existing on social media is rapidly increasing as well. Perrie Edwards, Ed Sheeran, Taylor Swift and actor\
      \ Derek Luke have all fallen victim to these fake profiles, some created merely for comedic purposes, others legitimately pretending to be the celebrity in question, all however look for attention (Gizauskas, 2015).\_ This illustrates perfectly the negative\
      \ side effects our social media addictions, psychology Lecturer Ellen Boag specifically argues the creation of these fake accounts may come down to loneliness and the ideal they will attract people and followers if they pretend to be something they’re\
      \ not through fake celebrity status. This is an extremely unnerving and potentially psychologically damaging. Here’s a perfect example through a Perrie Edwards Impersonator. \r\n“I relate to Perrie very much,” she says. “We have a lot of similarities.\
      \ Being happy and sad at the same time—I see that in Perrie, and that’s me too. So it is definitely a homage to her and it is part of why she is my idol. When she and Zayn Malik broke up I took it pretty badly because I feel I ‘am’ her—but I got over it\
      \ slowly and have come to terms with it now” (@FakePerrieLM in, Gizauskas, 2015). \r\nAnd if this ideology doesn’t concern you I don’t know what will \r\nOkay kids, time to go play outside for a while. If you need me, contact me through carrier pigeon.\

      \ 2000's, skipping through this crazy kaleidoscope vortex of my favorite cartoon characters, all in in vibrant color; Inspector Gadget, Mario, Sonic, Speedy Gonzalez, JackJack Incredible, Pinky& the Brain, Johnny Bravo, even Cheshire Cat, for whom I have\
      \ an unnatural dislike. Lol! They all felt so alive and real!\_ I could almost touch them....and I tried. Even that cat *side stare* Lawyartist is Adetunji Muiz Onibanjo and our March PGI feature! He's a practicing Lawyer and Artist. He is a complete riot\
      \ and uber-talented! I see his work on the walls of my kids' rooms when the time comes! Here's our fun chat below! Enjoy! \r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tBut first...that\

      \ myself to one medium. When I have just an hour to spare, it’s almost always just graphite pencils and ink. A couple more hours on my hands and I usually add some colour (alcohol markers, oil/wax artist pencils, water colour). I aim to master digital\
      \ art this year as well. *fingers crossed* \_ \r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\nLawyartist was One a few days ago! Could you please describe the last one year, asLawyartist,\
      \ in three words? (This interview was conducted in January 2016) \_ Consistency. Experiments. Shock! \_ At what age did you begin to sketch/paint? What/Who encouraged you to continue?In what tangible ways have you developed this talent? \_ I have drawn/coloured\
      \ since my earliest memories. It’s weird because I never thought my talent was anything special until I noticed my friends’ stick figures remained the same over the years. Although my parents encouraged me to draw and colour early on, I’d say my first\
      \ motivation was a rivalry. A primary and secondary school rivalry I had with a now late friend, Dapo ‘Stunna’ Adenuga (RIP). We were both extremely competitive and always trying to outdraw one another. It has also always given me joy to draw things, especially\
      \ cartoons I watched or was just fond of as a child. I have developed this talent over the last year by being consistent (drawing every single day for the last six months and every other day for the preceding six months), watching videos on YouTube, stalking\
      \ my favourite artists on Instagram and most of all by the dreaded but trustworthy Messrs. Trial and Error. \_ What do you do with your drawings once you are done working on them? \_ Typically, I store them safely away in my portfolio or folder. If it’\
      s graphite based, I spray it with an aerosol fixative first, to avoid smudging. If it’s a commissioned piece, I inform the client and have it framed, picked up, posted or hand delivered as the case may be. Sometimes high quality prints of my work are made\
      \ upon completion, these are also for sale. Lastly, I flip through my body of work periodically to see what I could have done better and how far I have come. Self-assessment is crucial. \_ What does your creative workspace look like?\_ \_ Oh dear, it depends,\
      \ you know. Over this last year I traveled a little more than usual, so my workspace has had to go mobile several times. Quite a few of my best pieces started on a moving train (shout-out to EastMidlands trains), others on a friend’s desk or in the school\
      \ library. Wherever I set up, I prefer to have my sketching glove (a glove that partially covers my drawing hand to prevent it staining the paper), 0.3mm mechanical HB pencil, clipboard/sketchbook and good lighting. It’s simple, if you don’t have your\
      \ standards, the overall quality of your art will suffer. During the art process, my desk is usually messy, I clean up after I finish each piece and then mess it up again during the next one. It’s a cycle. \r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\
      \t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\_ How do you balance being an Artist with being a Lawyer? I'm assuming they are both time consuming? \_ Your assumption is correct, this is the question. I will say this however;\
      \ I love both art and law. They are both huge chunks of my life and personality, they both stand for different sides of me, so balancing them is super-tricky but a must. Lawyartist was born over the winter of my masters programme and existed side by side\
      \ by all my seminars, essays, examinations and dissertation. As the Almighty and my efforts would have it, I triumphed. This year sees me return to full time legal practice (i.e. a real life Harvey Specter, without the unrealistic fun) while remaining\
      \ The Lawyartist. This will definitely test my limits but I am prepared to keep the healthy balance going. If you could go somewhere, anywhere in the world, and sketch all day, where will it be? \_ The Louvre, Paris, never been there but it looks like\
      \ inspiration will find you once you get there. \_ What are your creative work must-haves?\_ \_ My favourite music playlist, TV show or movie I like and have already watched playing in the background. Already watched so I don’t have to pay attention to\
      \ it at the detriment of what I’m drawing. Drawn a lot to shows like Sons of Anarchy, yesterday it was Boardwalk Empire Season 1, Episodes 3-5. Thus, I usually prefer to have two screens if I’m drawing for long, my iPad and MacBook or my MacBook and my\
      \ old laptop. One screen to search/display sources of inspiration and the other to show my slight distraction i.e. a video/my Twitter timeline (those guys are so funny). When no screens are available, the Drawing playlist on Spotify will do, highly recommended.\
      \ Sharp pencils are also a must (which is why I prefer mechanical pencils for sketching, they don’t get blunt, just click). \_ Those cotton buds! Lol! Where did you learn to smudge with those? \r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\
      \t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\_ I just improvised one day when I was too frustrated to sharpen a proper blending stump or as they are called 'tortillions'. It’s a bad habit, which has stuck. Don’t worry, I have clean ears,\
      \ I promise. I think. \_ What location/time do you get most of your ideas? [Examples of answers: on a run, driving, the shower, on the toilet seat] \_ All of the above, inspiration is such a strange creature. \_ \r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\
      \t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\nDo you ever have a creative block? What do you do? \_ Well right now, I’m just trying to become a pretty sick artist so not every drawing is entirely creative. I make my own\
      \ characters and concepts occasionally but primarily focus on old school cartoons and themes to draw, so I don’t have to be creative every single day (yes, remember Lawyartist draws every single day even after work). However, even drawing something that\
      \ already exists has its ‘block’ periods. So what do I do? I either watch a movie to ease up or if that isn’t feasible I look for something I would ordinarily really feel like drawing and force myself because I have an endgame in sight for my art. I have\
      \ to be epic. \_ What/Who is your most recurrent muse? I’ll categorise them for clarity sake: Artist muse: There are sooooo many, mostly itsbirdy, Art_of_Supershinobi and Adxnna. \_ Fashion muse: Fisayo Longe, Estaregrams and TheOrangeNerd of OrangeCulture.\
      \ \_ Cartoon muse: Stewie from Family Guy \_ What's the longest time you've spent on a piece? \_ A total of 18 hours, in four sessions. It was an Iron man oil pencil piece. \_ What is the quirkiest thing about you?  My thought process. \r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\
      \t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\_ Who is your favorite TV villain, present or past? \_ So tough, it’s between Bane and The Joker from The Dark Knight Trilogy. Recently, Kylo Ren from\
      \ Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens became number three. If I had to pick one, it would be Bane. Kylo Ren’s getup though, so coooooool! \_ Any other hobbies? \_ I am a former gym rat that now does home workouts. I run long distances, skip, swim\
      \ and occasionally play basketball and football. \_ What app do you use the most on your phone? \_ Since Lawyartist’s inception, it’s been Instagram, easily. Spotify, Twitter and my Dictionary.com app are not far behind. \_ What do you feed your inner\
      \ child? How do you keep your playful self alive? Do you watch cartoons/ animations? \_ Spot on, I feed my inner child anime and my favourite movies. It’s weird because I draw cartoons way more than I watch them, especially the new ones. e.g. Adventure\
      \ Time, The Regular show, Frozen etc. \r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\_ What are you reading these days? \_ I need to do better in this regard as I used to be an avid\
      \ reader. Today, I read NatGeo’s 100 Events That Changed The World. Once work resumes in a couple of weeks, it will be court cases and case reports etc. \_ What would you rather be reading? \_ A billion zeros in my bank account. In Pounds. \_ Lagos or\
      \ London? \_ Lagos \_ What do you love about Lagos? \_ Its unpredictability (such a gift and a curse). Both of Lawyartist’s parents are from Lagos, so it’s truly home. \_ Pounded yam or Amala? \_ You saved the toughest choice for last. ARGHHHH, URGGGGGH,\
      \ Amala, forgive me. Thank you so much, Lawyartist for this fun interview and for inspiring through your work and aspirations!  \r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\_4\
      \ Things I learnt!1. That someone else agrees with me on Kylo Ren's outfit! If I could, I'd wear it as Pj's. Looking dope in my sleep 2. \"If you don't have standards, the quality of your work will suffer.\" 3. Cotton buds make amazing smudging blenders!\
      \ After this interview, I tried using cotton buds (q-tips)\_to smudge my eye-pencil on my lower lash line! Thanks Lawyartist, for the unintentional makeup hack. 4. Believe in what you do, do not stop, ever, ever and cyber-stalk your fave cyber-mentors.\

      \ Select \r\n\r\nBOOK SYNOPSIS\r\nHolly Jacobs loses her heart a little too easily. Never again. But when she meets the sexy soldier on the beach, Holly knows she’s in big trouble. Zack Winter is gorgeous and in pain, and when he kisses Holly, all of her\
      \ resolve melts away… \r\nZack is on short-term leave to attend a funeral, and he’s walking a fine line. The loss is unbearable…and he’ll do whatever it takes to distract himself from it. Especially if it means a night of searingly-hot sex with Holly Jacobs.\

      \ and getting involved with Zack was dumb on an epic level. I was incapable of having a no-strings fling. For me, it was all or nothing, and this time I was going to make the sane decision. \r\n“Why don’t you call me just Holly?” Asking him another question\
      \ was harmless. \r\nI saw a flash of white teeth in the darkness. “I like your name.” He sounded amused. “Is that okay, Just-Holly?” \r\nDear God. In the middle of his grief and distress, he still had a sense of humor. I really needed to escape before\
      \ I found any more reasons to linger. But I didn’t move an inch. \r\n“You sure you don’t want to come back to my place?” His whisper reverberated through me, turning my spine liquid and my knees to jelly. He shifted position slightly and I felt him trailing\
      \ a hand up my back, the fingertips tiptoeing with excruciating slowness and precision. \r\n“Zack, I don’t do one-night stands.” \r\n“I’m here for two nights.” \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTHOR BIO\r\nRomance author Sofia Grey spends her days managing projects\

      \ instead of studying (model student) and was reading a post by Leta from The Nerdy Me and decided to have a Q&A of sorts on my blog and answer the questions she had listed!  1.\_ What is your favourite sweet treat?Dark chocolate.\_ 100%.\_ It's the only\
      \ chocolate I really like if I'm honest!\_ And a good dark chocolate truffle is just delicious!\_ When I was little and we'd go to a lolly shop, everyone would expect me (and my older brother) do go for the colourful lollies in the jars up on the wall\
      \ but we'd always go for the chocolate truffles!\_ We do love a good chocolate ganache truffle! 2.\_ What is your dream vacation?I would love to say everywhere.\_ But narrowing it down a little, I'd love to travel to all the places of where I come from.\_\
      \ Where my family is from.\_ I've seen photos, oh so many photos, but now I just really want to experiences the places for myself!\_ So Poland, Croatia, England, Scotland and also the New York area to see family!\_ That is the dream! 3.\_ What are your\
      \ plans for the weekend?I have the BEST weekend planned!\_ It's a long weekend here so no uni for my on Monday but oh my goodness jam packed long weekend.\_ I'm going to clean, do exercise, procrastinate, study, eat, sleep, clean some more, study again,\
      \ freak out because I don't understand the assignment, worry because I'm waiting on marks to be released, watch YouTube videos.\_\_ So you know, a very relaxing and exciting long weekend! 4.\_ When was the last time you drove out of town?Two weekend ago\
      \ the fam and I went on a little drive to the coast!\_ Was so nice!\_ I did bring uni work but didn't end up looking at any of it!\_ Driving and seeing the Bass Straight brought me right back to my childhood when we'd go up to the coast and it makes me\
      \ want to move to somewhere closer to the beach! 5.\_ Who would you like to see in concert?So many people!\_ I was lucky enough to see Ed Sheeran last December (post about that here) but I would really love to see Little Mix, Coldplay, Ellie Goulding,\
      \ Adele, One Direction, Circa Waves, MyFly, Tori Kelly, Troye Sivan!\_ SO MANY PEOPLE!!!\_ Little Mix are actually doing a show on my birthday this year...\_ Only problem is I couldn't get tickets and it's in Melbourne and I'd have to organise flights\
      \ and hotels and gah one day I'll get there! 6.\_ What is your song of the week?This one is tough.\_ I have two, so it's a tie!\_ Hymn For The Weekend by Coldplay and also Never Be Like You by Flume!\_ Never Be Like You is the first song I'll play on my\
      \ Spotify at the start of the day and I'm just really enjoying that style of music at the moment!\_ And Coldplay has always been a favourite of mine!\_ They were incredible at the Super Bowl and also the BRIT Awards!\_ *adding this in later - Nobody Love\
      \ by Tori Kelly, THOSE VOCALS!!* 7.\_ Which TV show universe, past or present, would you love to be a part of?I have two again....\_ Castle and Friends.\_ I adore Castle and honestly would play the person who got murdered.\_ But I'd want to be killed because\
      \ I was trying to save someone, not because I've robbed a bank or had some shady past which has come to bite me on the bum!\_ And Friends because that was my childhood.\_ I thought I was the coolest girl at school, the day after the baby was named Emma!\
      \ 8.\_ What was the last item of clothing you purchased?I was really hoping I'd have a cool answer for this...\_ You know a nice dress or something.\_ But no I bought a pair of sockettes on my first day back at uni.\_ They are, as sockettes go, so good!\_\
      \ They don't slip down, they're comfy - probably my favourite ones that I've ever bought! 9.\_ What is the one thing you love the most about blogging?The people.\_ I can't say I've met any bloggers in person but \"meeting\" over the internet then yes!\_\
      \ I've met some amazing people and so I am one day able to hang out with them in real life! 10.\_ One sentence or phrase you would say to your younger self?Trust your instinct.\_ You know when you first meet someone and you just have a feeling about them,\
      \ whether it's positive or negative..\_ I'd trust that instinct more often.\_ And it's not just with meeting people.\_ If you're in a situation that you're not cool with, get out before anything happens.\_ Emma, you trust your gut when you're feeling sick\
      \ so use this gut instinct more please! Thank you Leta for the lovely questions!\_ I extremely recommend you all to go and give some love to her blog because it is one of my favourites to read!\_ And also, feel free to answer one or some of the questions\
      \ in the comments or do a post about them!\_ Let me know if you have! Until next time, keep smiling :)\_ Em xx  PS!! Come and say hello!!! :) xTwitter | Instagram | Google+ | Bloglovin]]></summary>\r\n  <languageCode>en</languageCode>\r\n  <published>2016-03-12\
